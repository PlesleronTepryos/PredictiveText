# PredictiveText
A reasonably simple algorithm to generate nonsensical filler text from a given source.

If you want to make your own, you must initialize the class with a paragraph-esque block of text. There should be no more than one whitespace between words. With the exception of the Old Testament, every example shows how simple it is to 'flatten' the input.

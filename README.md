# PredictiveText
A reasonably simple algorithm to generate nonsensical filler text from a given source.

I got bored so I made the source text the Old Testament.
There's a tiny vestigial function in the program to turn the text file into something friendly for the program to process.
If you would like to change the input, you can simply initialize the class with a different 'paragraph' (any long single text with sentences seperated by spaces).

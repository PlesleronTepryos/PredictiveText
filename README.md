# PredictiveText
A reasonably simple algorithm to generate nonsensical filler text from a given source.

I got bored so I made the source text the Old Testament.
If you would like to change the input, you can simply initialize the class with a different 'paragraph' (any long single text with sentences seperated by spaces).
